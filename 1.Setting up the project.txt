# Project Setup Summary

## Part 1: Setting up the project

1. **Folder Structure and Dependencies**
    - Created `frontend` and `backend` folders.
    - Installed necessary dependencies for both frontend and backend.

2. **Backend Setup**
    - Set up an Express server in the backend running on port 3000.
    - Created an API endpoint at `api/v1/ping` which responds with a message "pong".

3. **Frontend Setup**
    - Used Axios in the frontend to make requests to the backend server.
    - Implemented caching functionalities using React Query (TanStack Query) in `main.jsx`:
      - Set up `QueryClientProvider` with `queryClient`.
      - Used the `useQuery` hook to manage `isLoading`, `data`, and `error` states.
    - In `App.jsx`, implemented caching with `staleTime` and `cacheTime` to understand their applications.

4. **Testing and Output**
    - Simulated a slow network (3G) to observe the loading state.
    - Created a toggle button to cache the response message for 10 seconds. This allows the response to be retrieved from the cache instead of hitting the API endpoint again.

5. **Component Structure**
    - Followed the atomic model of components: atoms, molecules, and organisms, in increasing order of complexity.

## Part 2: Concepts Encountered

1. **TanStack Query Installation and Application**
    - **StaleTime**: The duration until a query transitions from fresh to stale. While fresh, data is read from the cache only, with no network requests. When stale, data is still read from the cache, but a background refetch can occur under certain conditions.
    - **CacheTime**: The duration until inactive queries are removed from the cache. Defaults to 5 minutes. Queries become inactive when no components are observing them (i.e., all components using the query have unmounted).

2. **HTTP Requests in React**
    - **Fetch API**: Built-in browser method for making HTTP requests.
    - **Axios**: A third-party library for making HTTP requests, offering additional features over the Fetch API.
