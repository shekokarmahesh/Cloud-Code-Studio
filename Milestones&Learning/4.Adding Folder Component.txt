The http module in Node.js creates a common server object with the capabilities of an Express app. 
This server is then passed into Server(server) to enable WebSocket functionality. 
Since WebSockets operate over TCP connections, the combined server is started using server.listen() instead of app.listen(). 
This allows both the Express app and WebSocket to run on the same PORT. 
Additionally, socket.io uses an event-driven mechanism to handle real-time communication efficiently 

This code is a **React component** called `TreeNode` that displays a **tree structure** for file and folder data. Here's a simple explanation:

---

### Key Concepts:
1. **What is a TreeNode?**
   - A `TreeNode` represents one node in a tree structure. Each node can be:
     - A **folder** (which might have children, i.e., other files or folders).
     - A **file** (which doesn't have children).

2. **React Icons:**
   - `IoIosArrowForward` and `IoIosArrowDown` are used to display collapsible icons for folders:
     - `IoIosArrowForward` ‚û°Ô∏è indicates the folder is **collapsed**.
     - `IoIosArrowDown` ‚¨áÔ∏è indicates the folder is **expanded**.

3. **State Management (`useState`):**
   - A `visibility` state is used to track whether a folder is expanded or collapsed.
   - The state is an object where keys are folder names and values are `true` (expanded) or `false` (collapsed).

---

### Code Breakdown:

1. **Props:**
   - The `TreeNode` component takes `fileFolderData` as a prop. This is the data for the current node, which includes:
     - `name`: The name of the file/folder.
     - `children`: An array of child nodes (if it's a folder).

2. **State Initialization:**
   - `visibility` is initialized as an empty object.
   - This will be used to keep track of which folders are expanded.

3. **Toggle Visibility Function:**
   - `toggleVisibility(name)` updates the visibility state for a specific folder:
     - If the folder is currently collapsed (`false`), it will be expanded (`true`), and vice versa.
   - The state is updated immutably using the spread operator (`...`).

4. **Rendering Logic:**
   - The `TreeNode` checks if the current node (`fileFolderData`) has children:
     - **If it has children (a folder):**
       - A button is rendered with the folder name and an arrow icon.
       - Clicking the button toggles the visibility of the folder.
     - **If it doesn't have children (a file):**
       - A simple paragraph (`<p>`) with the file name is displayed.
   - If the folder is expanded (`visibility[fileFolderData.name] === true`), the component recursively renders its children using the `TreeNode` component.

5. **Styling:**
   - Inline styles are applied to control the layout, padding, and color of the text.

---

### Example Input:

Here's what `fileFolderData` might look like:
```javascript
const fileFolderData = {
  name: "root",
  children: [
    {
      name: "Folder1",
      children: [
        { name: "File1.1" },
        { name: "File1.2" },
      ],
    },
    {
      name: "Folder2",
      children: [
        { name: "File2.1" },
      ],
    },
    { name: "File3" },
  ],
};
```

### How It Works:
- For the above input, the component would:
  1. Render "root" as the top-level folder.
  2. Clicking on "Folder1" or "Folder2" toggles their visibility and reveals their respective children.
  3. Files like "File3" are displayed as plain text.

---

### Summary:
- This code dynamically renders a tree structure for files and folders.
- It uses a recursive approach: each folder's children are rendered by another `TreeNode` component.
- State (`visibility`) ensures that only the expanded folders display their children.

Sure! Let me explain this code **line by line** so it's easy to follow:

---

### Imports:
```javascript
import { IoIosArrowForward, IoIosArrowDown } from "react-icons/io";
```
- **What it does:** 
  - Imports arrow icons from the `react-icons` library. 
  - `IoIosArrowForward` (‚û°Ô∏è) will indicate a collapsed folder.
  - `IoIosArrowDown` (‚¨áÔ∏è) will indicate an expanded folder.

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";
```
- **What it does:** 
  - Imports the `useState` hook from React, which helps manage the visibility of folders (expanded or collapsed).

---

### TreeNode Component:
```javascript
export const TreeNode = ({ fileFolderData }) => {
```
- **What it does:** 
  - Defines a functional React component named `TreeNode`.
  - **Takes `fileFolderData` as a prop**, which contains the name and (optionally) children of the current node (file or folder).

---

### State Declaration:
```javascript
const [visibility, setVisibility] = useState({});
```
- **What it does:** 
  - Creates a `visibility` state to store which folders are expanded or collapsed.
  - `visibility` is an object where:
    - Keys are folder names.
    - Values are `true` (expanded) or `false` (collapsed).

---

### Function to Toggle Visibility:
```javascript
function toggleVisibility(name) {
    setVisibility({
        ...visibility,
        [name]: !visibility[name]
    });
}
```
- **What it does:**
  - Toggles the visibility of a folder when it‚Äôs clicked.
  - `name` is the folder name.
  - **How it works:**
    - Copies the current `visibility` object using `...visibility`.
    - Updates the value for the `name` key:
      - If it was `false` or `undefined`, it becomes `true`.
      - If it was `true`, it becomes `false`.

---

### Rendering:
```javascript
return (
    <div>
        {fileFolderData && 
```
- **What it does:** 
  - Starts rendering the component.
  - Checks if `fileFolderData` exists before proceeding.

---

#### Folder/Child Wrapper:
```javascript
<div style={{ paddingLeft: "16px", color: "white" }}>
```
- **What it does:** 
  - Wraps each node (file or folder) with some left padding for indentation.
  - Sets the text color to white.

---

#### If the Node is a Folder:
```javascript
{fileFolderData.children ? (
    <button
        onClick={() => toggleVisibility(fileFolderData.name)}
        style={{
            border: "none",
            cursor: "pointer",
            outline: "none",
            color: "black",
            paddingTop: "15px",
            fontSize: "16px"
        }}
    >
```
- **What it does:** 
  - If the current node (`fileFolderData`) has `children`, it‚Äôs a folder.
  - Renders a button with the folder name.
  - **Button Behavior:**
    - Clicking the button calls `toggleVisibility(fileFolderData.name)` to expand or collapse the folder.
  - **Styling:** Makes the button look clean and clickable.

---

#### Show Arrow Based on Visibility:
```javascript
{visibility[fileFolderData.name] ? 
    <IoIosArrowDown style={{ fontSize: "16px" }} /> : 
    <IoIosArrowForward style={{ fontSize: "16px" }} />
}
{fileFolderData.name}
```
- **What it does:** 
  - Displays an arrow:
    - `IoIosArrowDown` (‚¨áÔ∏è) if the folder is expanded.
    - `IoIosArrowForward` (‚û°Ô∏è) if the folder is collapsed.
  - Shows the folder‚Äôs name next to the arrow.

---

#### If the Node is a File:
```javascript
) : (
    <p
        style={{
            paddingTop: "10px",
            cursor: "pointer",
            fontSize: "16px",
            marginLeft: "5px",
            color: "black"
        }}
    >
        {fileFolderData.name}
    </p>
)}
```
- **What it does:** 
  - If the node doesn‚Äôt have children, it‚Äôs a file.
  - Renders the file‚Äôs name as a simple paragraph (`<p>`).
  - **Styling:** Adds some padding and a pointer cursor for interactivity.

---

### Render Children Recursively:
```javascript
{visibility[fileFolderData.name] && 
    fileFolderData.children && 
    fileFolderData.children.map((child) => (
        <TreeNode
            key={child.name}
            fileFolderData={child}
        />
    ))
}
```
- **What it does:** 
  - If the folder is expanded (`visibility[fileFolderData.name] === true`), it renders its children.
  - Calls the `TreeNode` component recursively for each child in `fileFolderData.children`.
  - **Key:** Uses `child.name` as the unique key for React to manage rendering efficiently.

---

### Closing Tags:
```javascript
</div>
    }
</div>
```
- **What it does:** 
  - Closes the wrapper `<div>` for the current node and ensures all child nodes (if any) are nested properly.

---

### Example Flow:
Suppose `fileFolderData` is:
```javascript
{
  name: "Folder1",
  children: [
    { name: "File1.1" },
    {
      name: "SubFolder1",
      children: [{ name: "File1.2" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

1. `Folder1` will be rendered with an arrow (‚û°Ô∏è by default).
2. Clicking `Folder1` toggles its visibility (`IoIosArrowDown` ‚¨áÔ∏è will appear).
3. `File1.1` and `SubFolder1` will render beneath `Folder1`.
4. Clicking `SubFolder1` toggles its visibility, showing/hiding `File1.2`.
