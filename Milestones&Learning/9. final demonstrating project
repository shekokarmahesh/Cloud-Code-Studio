on making project live
1. cd frontend  runs on port 5173
then npm run dev
2. cd backend   runs on port 3000
then npm run dev 
3. cd backend   runs on port 4000
then node src/terminalApp.js
these 3 command will run your project

after that when you visit localhost:5173 you will see the project running
in terminal you can cd sandbox and will able to see the project files in that folder
to run the project first install node modules by running npm install
then do npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 to run the project this will run the command in docker container
and you will be able to load your browser preview window also with that
//
but the changes made into any file doesn't get reflected in the browser preview window
to reflect the changes in the browser preview window you need to restart the project by running the command npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
